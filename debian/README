The Debian Package blitzortung-tracker
--------------------------------------

On older systems (prior to Debian Squeeze or Ubuntu 10.4, which do not include the boost math library, data statistics in blitzortung-data is not available, in this case libboost-math-dev is not available and can be omitted from the following commands.

The minimum gcc version required is 4.4.

To build the package, first install the missing dependencies via
> sudo apt-get install debhelper build-essential autotools-dev libtool fakeroot
> sudo apt-get install libboost-program-options-dev libboost-date-time-dev libboost-regex-dev libboost-math-dev libcppunit-dev liblog4cpp5-dev libjson0-dev

> make -f Makefile.cvs

The go to the source package directory blitzortung-tracker to create the package via

> dpkg-buildpackage

After the successful compilation, you will find a debian package of blitzortung-tracker in the folder which contains
the package source directory.

You can now install the package via
>  sudo dpkg -i ../blitzortung-tracker_<version>_<architecture>.deb
(the filename depends on the given architecture)

After the software is installed, edit the settings file
  /etc/default/blitzortung-tracker
to contain your username/password and the desired baudrate and gps settings.

After restarting the tracker-service via
> /etc/init.d/blitzortung-tracker restart
the new configuration is active.

The software should start automatically after a reboot.
